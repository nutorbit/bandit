# Bandit

This repository aims to provide the simple code and tutorial for bandit algorithm.

## What is bandit algorithm?

Bandit or Multi-Armed Bandit or Contextual Bandit is a problem in reinforcement learning. It is a problem where an agent has to choose one of the actions from a set of actions. The agent gets a reward for each action and the goal is to maximize the total reward.

## Setup

This repository uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency manager. To install the dependencies, run:

```zsh
$ poetry install
```

To activate the virtual environment, run:

```zsh
$ poetry shell
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add contextual bandit algorithms such as LinUCB, LinThompsomSampling, etc.
